Er redet in Gleichnissen, die niemand wirklich versteht, stillt einen wütenden Sturm, gibt den Blinden ihr Augenlicht zurück und hilft denen, die niemand als wert erachtet.

İsa mucizevi doğumundan mezardan dirilişine kadar daima insanları şaşırtmaktadır. Luka Kitabındaki yazılardan O’nun hayatını, bütün mucizelerini, öğretilerini ve tutkusunu izleyin.   Tanrı herşeyi yaratır ve insanları sever. Ancak insanlar Tanrı’ya itaatsizlik eder. Tanrı ve insanlar ayrılır ancak Tanrı insanları çok sever ve insanlar için bir çözüm hazırlar. Oğlu, İsa’yı bizim günahlarımıza karşılık kusursuz bir kurban olarak gönderir.   İsa gelmeden önce Tanrı insanları hazırlar. Peygamberler İsa’nın doğumu, yaşamı ve ölümü hakkında konuşur.   İsa dikkatleri üzerine çeker. O kimsenin anlamadığı benzetmeler ile öğretir, körün gözünü açar, kimsenin yardıma değer görmediği insanlara yardım eder.   Yahudi liderlerini korkutur ve tehdit olarak görülür. Böylece Yahuda İskariyot’u ve Romalı zalimleri İsa’nın çarmıha gerdirilmesi için ayarlarlar. Konunun çözüldüğünü düşünürler. Ancak İsa’ya hizmet eden kadınlar mezarı boş bulurlar. Öğrenciler panik içindedir. İsa onlara göründüğünde gerçek olduğundan şüphe duyarlar. Ancak O daima bunu bildirmiştir: O ölümü yenen Kurtarıcıları, kusursuz kurbandır. Cennete yükselirken izleyicilerinin diğerlerine kendisi ve öğretileri hakkında anlatmasını söyler.');
